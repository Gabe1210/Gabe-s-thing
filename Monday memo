Cook County vaccine interest survey
Approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 12 and up is expected very soon. To gauge how many parents
want to have their children vaccinated, the Cook County Department of Public Health invites you to complete
this interest survey. Also, to accommodate parents who may be working, beginning Tuesday, May 11, all of the
Cook County mass vaccination sites that provide the Pfizer vaccine will be extending their hours to 8:00 a.m. -
8:00 p.m. For more information, visit https://vaccine.cookcountyil.gov/.
Bridge Week: May 24 - 27
No final exams are being given for semester 2. Instead, Bridge Week is an opportunity for work completion.
Teachers will inform students about what is possible and not possible. Students with an excessive amount of
incomplete work will not necessarily be able to make it all up. More detailed information about Bridge Week will
be shared this week. In the meantime, here is some planning information:
● Bridge Week is only for freshmen, sophomores, and juniors. The last day of classes for seniors is Friday,
May 21, and they should be working with their teachers to turn in missing assignments by then.
● The A/B schedule during Bridge Week has been modified (see below) so that students have a last
opportunity to attend each of their classes in person.
● Students are expected to attend all of their classes each day of Bridge Week.
Gradebook closures
If you want to check your students’ grades, now is the time! For the last few days of each semester, access to
Gradebook is turned off for families and students. This is because grades can be very much in flux during this
time, as teachers work on adding makeup work, retests, final projects, etc. Teachers need this time to finalize
grades so that when families access them, the grades are accurate. Here is the schedule for Gradebook closure.
● Gradebook inaccessible to seniors: 7:00 a.m., Thursday, May 20
● Gradebook inaccessible to freshmen, sophomores, and juniors: 7:00 a.m., Wednesday, May 26
● Gradebook reopens to all students: 12 p.m., Friday, June 4
Keep following the three W’s!
Though the state is gradually opening up and vaccination is more widespread, public health officials are clear
that safety precautions should still be followed: Wear a mask. Watch your distance. Wash your hands. Together,
we can continue to keep all in our community health and safe.
