Saliva drop-off schedule beginning TODAY, April 19
In order to bring consistency to our saliva testing schedule, we’ve updated the saliva sample drop-off days as
listed below. Students need to drop off only ONCE per week, on one of their designated days as follows:
● Last name A - L: Drop off on Monday OR Tuesday
● Staff, regardless of last name:Drop off on Wednesday
● Last name M - Z: Drop off on Wednesday OR Thursday
Please note that there is no longer a separate drop-off day for students participating in athletics,
behind-the-wheel activities, etc.You must drop off your saliva sample by 1 p.m. according to the alphabetic
schedule above.
About those yellow checkmarks…
The daily symptom screener for students has a new feature: A yellow check mark appears as a reminder that a
saliva sample is due. The check mark will appear for three days in a row. A sample must be submitted no later
than 1 p.m. on the third day, or you will receive a red X on the fourth day and your student will not be
allowed on campus until another sample has been submitted and cleared by the testing lab.
Updates about graduation and prom
Graduation is being held in the stadium on Saturday, May 29. We’ll have two back-to-back ceremonies, at 3:00
p.m. and 6:00 p.m., each with half the graduates. Sunday, May 30, is now the rain date, as we are not permitted
by the health department to hold any indoor ceremony.
After announcing these plans, we received emails from students and parents asking us to change our decision
and allow only one ceremony. Because many of you have likely seen these concerns shared on social media, we
want to explain the thinking behind the decision to hold two ceremonies:
More than 50% of the respondents to our survey asked for something other than a single ceremony. This result
mattered to us. In addition, when we disaggregated the respondents’ data by race, we saw that our students of
color were under-represented in the results. Given the pattern of responses, if we were to project the results to
include our entire senior class, the percentage of students who would prefer something other than a single
ceremony would only increase. Also, note that these results were when we were proposing four-to-five different
ceremonies. Downshifting to two ceremonies allowed us to come as close as we could to a middle ground and to
preserve as much of our traditional commencement as possible.
Regarding prom, after much conversation with the health department, we concluded that the school simply will
not be permitted to hold a dance with all students in attendance together. Because the students on the prom
committee have said that this is the most important element of the event, we will instead host a Senior
Celebration at Great America on Saturday, May 8. The event will be free and open to all seniors.
Keep following the three W’s!
Though vaccination is becoming more widespread, public health officials are clear that safety precautions should
still be followed: Wear a mask. Watch your distance. Wash your hands. Together, we can continue to keep all in
our community health and safe
