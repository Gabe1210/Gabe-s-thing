A reminder that we’ve changed the order of A/B days during the Bridge Week, May 24-27, so students have
a day with each of their teachers. You can always find the link to the calendar under Quick Links at
oprfhs.org. The most recent revision is dated April 19; if you land on an older version, refresh the page to

Update on potential for block scheduling and a later start time
In our most recent Thoughtexchange, we asked students, faculty/staff, and families what we should
prioritize as we plan for a post-pandemic future. Both students and faculty/staff identified implementing a
block schedule and moving to a later start time as top recommendations. To make sure we’ve considered all
of the ramifications of such changes, an internal team will take the next several months to study the options
. The soonest we might possibly be able to make these changes would be the 2022-2023 school year; that
decision would need to be made this coming fall, before students start course selection for 2022-2023.
Stayed tuned for an update on our research sometime in the fall.
Attendance change
Due to state-mandated changes to how we must record student attendance during hybrid learning, the
Hybrid Absent notation will no longer be used. Whenever your student is attending remotely, even if it is
on a day they are scheduled to be in person, you will see the Remote Learning notation on their attendance
record. This notation does not count as an absence, and there is no need to contact the school if your child
will be attending remotely on a day they are scheduled to be in the building. Their teachers will “see” them
honline in the remote classroom.
Bringing back a principal position
Two years ago, we eliminated the position of principal and folded those responsibilities into the roles of
associate superintendent and directors of student learning and student services. This organizational
structure allowed us to introduce the position of executive director of equity and student success, which
better aligned the work of the strategic plan to our leadership structure without incurring additional
staffing costs.
We need and will keep the equity director position. However, not having a principal has proved to be the
challenge that many predicted. It has created stakeholder confusion by eliminating the “face of the school,”
reduced hands-on building leadership that is essential to the student experience, and created an
unsustainable role for the associate superintendent.
Thus, we have posted a new position for next school year: assistant superintendent/principal. We are adding
assistant superintendent to the title for two reasons: (1) We want to attract principals with experience
leading comprehensive high schools like ours, and given that we are late in the hiring season, this title will
help. (2) It better characterizes the unique expectations of this position. Usually, principals do not have the
district-level responsibilities that are unavoidable in this single building district, and the title provides for a
transparency in the posting that we think is important to convey. As we did two years ago, we are able to
keep this organizational change cost neutral through attrition and reassignment of some job
responsibilities.
Cause for applause!
