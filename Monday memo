Happy National Teacher Appreciation Week!
As we close out what has been the most challenging school year of our lifetime, I am more grateful
than ever for the outstanding faculty of OPRF. Our teachers, as well as counselors, social workers,
psychologists, speech pathologists, and certified school nurses (who all are also members of Faculty
Senate), have gone above and beyond for both their students and their colleagues. They’ve found
unique and inspiring ways to provide instruction and support throughout this global crisis, many of
them while dealing with their own difficulties and tragedies during the pandemic. Thank you, faculty,
for all you have done to make this year a success. You truly embody those things that are best.

The Asian American Experience: Community Education Event on May 20 at 7:00 p.m.
May is Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. In light of the recent rise in
AAPI hate crimes and violence, making space to acknowledge the impact that the historical and
present day anti-Asian sentiment has on our community is more important than ever. On May 20,
Districts 200, 97, and 90 and the Oak Park Public Library are partnering with community members to
host a virtual conversation about the racial equity challenges of our Asian-American community
members. Stay tuned for more information on this community event.
Keep following the three W’s!
Though vaccination is becoming more widespread, public health officials are clear that safety
precautions should still be followed: Wear a mask. Watch your distance. Wash your hands. Together, we
can continue to keep all in our community health and safe.
