your account. Senior textbooks were due on Friday; any senior who has not returned books should do so as soon
as possible. All textbooks for freshmen through juniors are due no later than Friday, May 28. Please visit the
Bookstore/North Cafeteria to return textbooks.

Plans for Fall 2021
Last week, the Illinois State Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution to support a future
declaration by Illinois State Superintendent of Education Carmen Ayala that all schools will return to fully
in-person learning for the 2021-2022 school year. If public health conditions stay on their current path, Supt.
Ayala anticipates making that declaration in the next several weeks. The resolution provides one exception to
in-person learning. Remote learning would still be required for students who are not eligible for a COVID-19
vaccine and also under a quarantine order. Students who do not meet both of these criteria may be eligible for
home-bound/hospital instruction.
Superintendents still have not received information from the state about any masking or social distancing
requirements for the fall. In the meantime, the Reimagine Education OPRF steering committee is moving
forward on creating a plan for full reopening of school this fall. The plan will be presented to the Board at the
June 10 Committee of the Whole.
Special Board meeting regarding grading policy
On Tuesday, May 25, at 8 p.m., the Board of Education will hold a special meeting to discuss a request by
ROYAL (Revolutionary Oak Park Youth Action League) to change the grading policies for second semester.
ROYAL has asked that no student receive a failing grade for second semester 2021 and that all students receive
credit for their current courses. The meeting agenda is posted herewith a link to watch the meeting virtually.

ever-changing environment. If you still would like to purchase a yearbook, go to Jostens.com. Please check your

Thank you!
In this final Monday Memo of the year, I want to thank you for the grit and persistence you have shown since
our building first shut down in March 2020. Whether you are a student, staff member, or parent/guardian, you
have faced your own unique challenges during the pandemic, and navigating them has been incredibly difficult
at times. I am proud of the way we have worked together as a community to stay as healthy and safe as possible
and to ensure that students have had the academic and social-emotional support they needed.
As I look toward my retirement on June 30, I also want to personally thank you for an amazing five years at Oak
Park and River Forest High School. These have been among the most challenging and rewarding years of my
career. Together, we have made tremendous progress in our efforts to achieve equity and excellence for all
students, and I look forward to watching from the sidelines as you continue this work.
I hope this summer allows you well-deserved time to rest, recover, and rediscover those things that bring you joy.
Please take care and be well.
